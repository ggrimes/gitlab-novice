-   View history using RStudio’s Git interface

## Introduction

Git tracks everything. This means you can always go back and see who
changed what, when, and why. This history is extremely useful for
debugging, collaboration, and documentation.

Let’s look at some tools for exploring that history.

## Using `git log`

The most basic command to view history is:

``` bash
git log
```

This shows:

-   The commit hash (a long ID)
-   Author
-   Date
-   Commit message

This gives you a full history of commits, starting from the most recent.

### Shorter Log View

Use `--oneline` for a more concise view:

``` bash
git log --oneline
```

This is helpful when scanning many commits quickly.

## Inspecting a Commit

To see exactly what was changed in a commit:

``` bash
git show <commit-id>
```

For example:

``` bash
git show a3f2d4e
```

This shows the diff (the change) introduced in that commit.

## Comparing Changes

Use `git diff` to compare versions:

-   Compare working directory to last commit:

    ``` bash
    git diff
    ```

-   Compare staged changes:

    ``` bash
    git diff --cached
    ```

-   Compare between two commits:

    ``` bash
    git diff abc123 def456
    ```
## On a specific file

You can do a  `git diff` with a specific a file and a specific revision to see changes made between and a previous version:

```bash
$ git diff [commit_ID] Readme.md
# Note A single git commit may contain multiple files.
```

It's important to note that any changes that have been staged but not yet committed will not be included in this git diff comparison.

Remember command only considers changes in the working directory that have not yet been staged.

```bash
$ git diff –-staged [commit_ID] Readme.md
```

## Shortcut

git diff HEAD~N Readme.md

```bash
$ git diff HEAD~2 Readme.md

```

## Show 

If you want the specific contents of a file at given revision you can do:

```bash
$ git show RevNum:Readme.md
```

## Restore

Replace a file in the current working directory with the version of it committed in a given branch:
Requires Git version 2.23+.. 

```bash
git restore Readme.md
```


## Using RStudio to Explore History

RStudio has a Git pane that allows you to explore commit history
graphically:

1.  Click on the **History** button in the Git pane.

2.  Select a commit to see:

    -   Author and date
    -   Commit message
    -   File changes

3.  You can **diff** individual files by selecting them.

This is a good way to review changes if you prefer a GUI over the
command line.

## Challenge: What Changed?

:::: challenge Open a repository (your project or a partner’s). Then:

1.  Run `git log --oneline` and pick an older commit.

2.  Use `git show` to see what was changed in that commit.

3.  Identify:

    -   Who made the change?
    -   What file(s) were edited?
    -   What was added or removed? :::

::: solution
``` bash
git log --oneline
git show <commit-id>
```


Look for:

-   Author and date near the top
-   File names and the actual line changes below
::::

## Bonus: Who Wrote This Line?

Git has a powerful blame tool:

``` bash
git blame README.md
```

This shows you, line by line, who last modified each part of the file.

Very useful for identifying the history of a specific part of the code.

::: keypoints
-   Use `git log` and `git show` to investigate project history
-   Use `git diff` to compare changes between commits
-   RStudio provides a GUI for exploring Git history
-   `git blame` can help identify the origin of specific lines
